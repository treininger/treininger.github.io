    <h1>Computer Mediated Communication and the Social Outcome</h1>
</div>  
    
<div class="grid-12">
    <p>In the contemporary digital age, people are able to communicate in numerous forms through the utilization of computer-mediated communication (CMC). The ability to interact and hold conversations with people is now easy, effortless, and above all, fast. At the tips of their fingers, users hold access to applications such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Skype, Snapchat, and countless others. CMC has become a necessity to society as a whole, and particularly to Millennials. In comparison to face-to-face communication, computer-mediated communication beneficially affects youth sociability through instant feedback, building closer ties with peers, community involvement, and social expectations. If concern for the lack of FtF social skills strengthens into a prominent issue, and people attempt to create a movement to cut back and discourage CMC usage, society loses the potential edge for advancement and as a result, America will risk falling behind in the technological race for rapidly growing, instant communicational development.</p>
    <p>In order to understand how CMC affects sociability in young adults, the fundamentals of CMC need to be defined. Yifeng Hu and S. Shyam Sundar define CMC as:</p>
       
    <blockquote><p> 
[…] human-human interaction via the computer. Some of the popular applications of CMC are email, instant messaging (IM), chat rooms, bulletin boards, and newsgroups. Compared to face-to-face (FtF) communication, CMC liberates communicators from the need to be physically co-present and thus from the consequent influence of nonverbal cues (Hu and Sundar 201).
</p></blockquote>
    <p> CMC has opened a massive door to the advancement of technology and sociability. Human beings can be more conversational than ever before. CMC offers an instant connection as opposed to a hand written letter, or lack of a physical audience.</p>
    <p>In a study conducted at Marist College in the Communications Department, eleven college students voluntarily contributed their reasoning as to why they utilize instant messaging (IM) programs. An answer commonly stated is, “ ‘a lot of our friends from last year are in different places now, so it's easier to keep in touch with them that way’ " (Kindred and Roper 51). Yet oddly, despite the statement, the results indicate, “Overall, participants stated they use IM more since coming to college and communicate more with campus friends than long-distance friends” (Kindred and Roper 51). Other participants input from the study explain why. Their responses include, “… laziness, ease of use, privacy with other people in the room, and the ability to multi-task with multiple IM conversations or other things such as watching television” (Kindred and Roper 51).  IM provides an easier way to communicate without putting effort into walking across campus or starting up a phone conversation when a student has a simple question to ask or something to share. </p>
    <p>Another factor that can help explain the reasoning behind the college students’ preferences involves human facial expressions. More particularly, if you will, the smiley face. The visual symbol “☺” existed way before the computer was invented. Yet the concept of an emoticon, a dash combined with a parenthesis “-)” wasn’t introduced until Kevin Mackenzie suggested the symbol as a way to indicate sarcasm online in order to improve the conveyance of online discussion. The actual emoticon “:)” didn’t come into play until three years later (Senft 178). Emoticons symbolize fun, cute ways to promote sentiment in CMC. Over time, they’ve continued to develop an increasing, almost subtle usefulness. Another study, conducted at Drexel University, utilized online chat rooms with math tutors in order to analyze how young people interacted with the tutors via IM. The researcher observed: </p>
    <blockquote><p>[…] discourse participants express interpersonal and affective stances by employing a variety of creative mechanisms derived from linguistic and paralinguistic devices, such as contractions of linguistic forms, prosodic features, gestures, and facial expressions (in the case of emoticons). This use suggests that effective interpersonal and emotional communication is a critical factor in enhancing group involvement and collaboration […] (Park 4). </p></blockquote>
    <p>In other words, people utilize emoticons as well as other forms of grammatical punctuation to convey the attitude of the words they’re submitting in the chat. Sometimes, attitudes can be conveyed by accident as well. For example, when my mother sent an email to a fellow employee, she accidently sent the email in all capital letters, leading the receiver to believe my mother was yelling at her. Without face-to-face communication, one can only assume what the other is inclining. In the aforementioned study, in correlation to emotion detection, another response explains, “ ‘I try to use them as much as possible just so people understand and they don't misconstrue what I'm trying to get across’ " (Kindred and Roper 51).  The problematic lack of emotion seems to be enough reason for people to prefer FtF due to frustration and false impressions possibly associated with CMC. Yet the presented strategies to implement emotion in CMC demonstrate that “nonverbal cues” are not necessarily a problem anymore (Derk 3). Before emoticons, users of CMC held no method of determining whether the sender intended their typed messages as sarcastic, serious, or humorous. Today, users hold entire lists of emoticons at the ready to convey their attitudes socially through IM services (Senft 178).</p>
    <p>Aside from IM, CMC provides a completely different realm to young adults in respect to their non computer-mediated communities. While some view the communication as an excellent advantage, others argue CMC leads to further “social isolation and communicative ineffectiveness” in the communities young adults inhabit. People apprehensive of technology are concerned CMC is becoming more of an addiction rather than an effective way to communicate and maintain social relationships (Taddei 15).  Despite the potential to increase sociability, the question arises as to whether or not CMC is causing college students to grow accustomed to more frequently remaining in their dorms, keeping to their own virtual social worlds rather than adapting and learning to be social and outgoing in the outdoor college environment. </p>
    <p>However, rather than simply jumping to the conclusion that people are becoming negatively addicted to CMC, the psychology department at the University of Firenze argues otherwise. The professors counter:</p>
    <blockquote><p>[…] the subjects who are lonely or suffer from social anxiety would be more inclined to reveal their true self, building more intimate relationships in a shorter period of time. This peculiarity to easily self-disclose would confirm that CMC with these types of subjects proves to be a very powerful instrument that facilitates the formation and the increase of interpersonal relations. (Taddei 14).</p></blockquote>
    <p>According to the department, despite the reasonable concerns involving, “social isolation,” the perspective on CMC users suggests an improvement in social interactions, promoting communicative effectiveness rather than “communicative ineffectiveness.” </p>
    <p>In addition, skeptics continue to argue CMC nonetheless fails to teach young adults how to socialize FtF. In gaining technical skills, people may be losing other important skills. In an online academic article titled “Young People, Ethics, and the New Digital Media,” professors from multiple prestigious universities describe technological concerns further, while countering with positive outcomes as well.  The authors address, “Youths need social skills to interact with society and to see themselves as part of it, and they need to be thoughtful and reflective about their actions. These key skills are not learned in a vacuum and certainly cannot be assumed to accompany technical skills” (James 268). However, young adults are continuing to gain social skills. Online, people have access to larger interest groups in the formats of forums, chat rooms, and blogs.  If a certain club isn’t provided or proves difficult to reach in a particular area, one simply has to go online (James 263). In concern to understanding how young adults need to understand the importance of remaining “thoughtful and reflective about their actions,” CMC provides the opportunity through allowing users to consider what they submit before pressing the send button. (Taddei 114).  Another CMC benefit provided by the former academic journal is that, “participation is not limited to those with specific credentials and attributes (race, class, sex, age, and so on). Thus, online spaces provide opportunities to move beyond consumption and reaction to the proactive creation of content […] ” (James 263).  The accessibility to CMC empowers youths on a sociable level without restraint. They are reaching out to strangers possessing similar interests, willingly generating discussions, and possibly extending their conversation to the point of working on projects together. Their spark for interest and their alacrity to contribute to conversation indicates their readiness to demonstrate their social skills. In addition, not only does CMC provide written messages. FtF communication is almost transforming into CMC through audio and video chatting. FtF social communication and skills are not becoming obsolete. Only the context is modified.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, despite the sociability of CMC, people may be turning a blind eye to what their local community has to offer. Critics state, “Participation in the new media is that individuals will overcommit to certain communities and fail to take advantage of the opportunity to be exposed to diverse perspectives” (James 267). Yet, as technology continues to advance, entire communities are turning towards CMC, and young adults are paving the way. The local communities are coming to the young adults via social media.  Today, various local businesses have social media pages, including libraries, volunteer services, and schools. On the Pew Research Center Website, statistics reveal 89% of young adults and 74% of adults with Internet access in America utilize social media websites. A large percentage of the population affiliate themselves with CMC, which in turn encourages communities to reach out to young adults in an effective, noticeable manner.</p>
    <p>In addition, skeptics are questioning social behaviors CMC may lead to, further expressing a viewpoint in concerning overdependence on audience. Adversaries explain that, “Although online spaces allow adolescents’ ideas, self- expressions, and confessions to be shared with others, the feedback that they seek and receive can be problematic. Opportunities for disclosure can set the stage for an overreliance on feedback, which can undercut autonomy and create fragile identities” (James 237).  In retrospect, young adults already possess “fragile identities.” Regardless of access to CMC, young adults are continually growing, attempting to figure out whom they are and how to function in society. Their vulnerability is prominent in FtF communication, existing in the lures of daily peer pressure at school and amongst friend groups. Skeptics argue CMC is promoting young adults to convey an outward, impressive appearance that appeals to a vast audience, yet they fail to realize young adults already attempt to create such a performance without CMC. Youthful nature has not changed.  CMC doesn’t hinder their ability to make their own decisions in social interaction; CMC enhances their sociability.  Furthermore, proponents argue CMC “[…] can aid the identity-formation process by providing new tools and diverse spaces for self-expression, self-reflection, and feedback from others” (James 232). The communication allows young adults to explore and practice their social skills. Through their experimentation, youths discover their abilities. Other social benefits include, “ […] self-reflection, and reflection can nurture greater awareness of one’s roles and responsibilities to oneself, to others, and to one’s community” (James 233).  CMC allows young adults to socialize on a comfortable, engaging level, broadening their minds and strengthening their societal ties.</p>
    <p>In retrospect, CMC is becoming a necessary, vital form of communication in today’s society. CMC provides effortless communication in order to be social, developing various ways to integrate sentiment into CMC when visual face-to-face contact is lacking, and provides various social communities to users. As time continues to move forward and more beneficial technological advances come into play, the issues and doubts concerning CMC appear to subtly fade. The community recognizes CMC’s powerful influence within our changing digital world, producing less reason to discourage CMC usage. As Researcher Franklin B. Krohn explains, “CMC is in its infancy. Much of the future of CMC is now in the hands of younger people who must decide for themselves whether […] communication writing rules and standards of the past now apply” (326).  As Krohn states, CMC is relatively new and developing.  Today’s young people are the first generation to ever grow up in a world revolving around computers and CMC.  Further research needs to be conducted as CMC continues to develop in order to truly determine how young adults socialize in comparison to face-to-face over time. As more concerns continue to arise and make themselves known, the best way to combat future CMC issues is through analyzing research results and performing meaningful experiments in order to problem solve and find solutions.</p>
