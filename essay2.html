    <h1> Behind Schedule: Conflicting Social Media and Employment </h1>
</div>
    
<div class="grid-12">
    <p>Within our technologically advancing world, social media has exploded over the past decade. Online networking websites have been speedily integrated into modern society’s daily lives. Consumed users utilize social media for purposes such as connecting with friends, sharing photographs, and planning group functions. In recent years, employers are investigating social media to perform a type of background screening check on their employees, in order to reassure that they will continue to positively represent their companies. However, despite the growth in Internet screening, young, college-aged social media users have yet to realize the pending consequences of online networking.</p>
    <p>	Throughout the decade, several social media posts gone wrong concerning employment have surfaced, and continue to do so. To demonstrate, an employee was terminated after posting remarks online about mentally ill patients that lived in the institution she worked for (Neal 1728). The employee was in clear violation of institution policy, not to mention the legal, medical privacy rights of the patients living in the facility. In correlation, another inappropriate circumstance occurred, when a lawyer took a personal weekend for a family death, rescheduling a hearing. However, upon looking at his social media account, the judge in charge discovered he lied and spent the weekend drinking (Delaney 91).  Imagine how the trustworthy image of a legal counsel can be altered in the eyes of their local community, following the immediate aftermath of the incident. While perhaps such examples may be identifiable as wrongful acts in need of repercussion, others may be more challenging to depict as inappropriate and illegal. Visualize a boss ending an employee’s career after he finds the employee complaining about his wages on social media (Neal 1723). A controversy took place, debating whether or not the post was associated with labor unions. While these examples hold a prominent connection to the employees’ current jobs and professional conduct, employers also look at content displayed non-related to work. A college student with promising prospects of becoming a summer camp counselor lost her opportunity after employers explicitly explained to her they discovered a picture of her at a drinking party The summer camp she applied for decided that she would “not make the best fit with their staff,” despite that in reality, the college student claims she was well rounded, and attending the drinking party was a one time event (Davison 39).  Among others, the anecdote is one of many recent stories arising from job seeking college students, unaware of the possible, eventual consequences that come with socializing online.</p>
    <p>Moreover, a recent development occurred involving a situation in which a Subway employee was fired as a result of posting a photo of herself on Facebook. On May 10th, 2015,   journalist Chris Perez broadcasted the headline, “Food Worker Fired after Praising Death of Two Cops,” on the publicized newspaper website, The New York Post. The featured article summarized that “A Subway sandwich shop worker sparked outrage on Twitter with her social media posts celebrating Saturday’s killing of two Mississippi cops — and now she’s been fired” (Perez 1). The viral photo reveals the employee is smiling in her Subway uniform, including a caption that announced the murders in a victorious manner. As a result, the Subway franchise fired her and released a disclaimer on social media, expressing that Subway does not hold the terminated employee’s values (Perez 2). Perez’s article reinforces that the topic of social media involved with employment issues is a relevant, highly publicized matter that demands the attention of social media users and employers alike. As more and more similar instances continue to pop up involving employees getting fired over both job-related and non-job related posts, the topic is becoming more widely known, leading to more publications and controversy. 
    </p>
    <p>While in some cases employers are reasonably justified, scholars observe companies are being restricted by an increase in legislation concerning social media accessibility to employees’ and job applicants’ online accounts in order to prevent employers from utilizing online content as a basis for termination. Through an analysis of both using and misusing online content on the behalf of employers and employees, researchers have discovered questionable invasive Internet screening methods, as well as unprofessional online postings regarding employees’ place of work. Social media users need to be informed at an earlier age (perhaps as they’re entering high school) of ways to protect their careers from employer accessibility, regardless of approved legislation defenses. </p>
    <p>Previously, investigation and research reveals the process of looking up employee profiles began in the year 2006, when the second most popular social networking site on the web, Facebook, created the option to allow viewers to freely look up user profiles in their search bar. Lawyer James Delaney presented surveys in his research generated by CareerBuilder that revealed between 2005 and 2009, the number of people accessing Facebook has multiplied by two every year, and their statistics illustrate that today, more than 70% of Americans possess a Facebook account (Delaney 87). In comparison to Delaney’s statistics, the Pew Research Center presents similar, more age specified quantitative data, illustrating that 90% of eighteen to twenty-nine year-olds with Internet access possess at least one social media account (Pew Research Center). While the majority of college-age students utilize social media, a greater percentage of employers conduct online searches. CareerBuilder discovered that 91% of employers utilize social media in their employment practices (Delaney 91). The statistics demonstrate that social media is a common digital tool, and the majority are familiar with at least one networking website in particular, Facebook.  Upon observation of the numbers, the chance of an employer discovering one’s account appears greater. Young users would benefit to educate themselves socially, ensuring they understand how to properly utilize the public, excessively shared space.  If employers see something they don’t find appealing on a social media profile, an (a future) employee can place their job at risk if they don’t know how to protect themselves. </p>
    <p>Furthermore, in light of the amount of employers that research social media accounts, more scholars are contributing to the conversation in recognition of the Internet screening trend. Before approximately 2008, not as many articles were published on the subject of companies implementing social media background checking, for the trend was believed to be nonexistent (Davison 39).  However, in Delaney’s CareerBuilder statistics, the survey revealed 69% of companies threw out an interviewee’s resume, based on their personal social media content. Now that companies themselves explicitly acknowledge the trend, more people have joined the scholarly conversation. Studies reveal that social media users believe employers are taking on invasive, overreaching practices that violate their privacy rights under the Fourth Amendment, along with Title VII under the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Neal 1720 and Brown 223). The legal documents were set in place in order to prevent employers from discriminating against job applicants during the hiring process. Regardless of legislation however, businesses aren’t currently required to report their findings on social media for hiring procedures, giving them the reigns to look at the potential future employee’s personal content in depth (Brown 223). In a sense, one might observe that employers have found a loophole, blind-siding unsuspecting employees and applicants.</p>
    <p>Despite that social media information isn’t included in the documentation part of the hiring process, employees, future applicants, and scholarly conversation participants have caught on to what’s happening behind closed corporation doors. In H. Kristl Davison, R. H. Hamilton, and Mark N. Bing’s article, “Big Brother Wants to ‘Friend’ You on Facebook,” the authors call out employers on the hiring issue, challenging the extent to which businesses should have power. The authors provokingly inquire, “Where does this kind of invasiveness take us in the future? Why don’t we just let our employers come in our houses and poke around in our dressers and read our diaries? Talk to our friends and family? Or even open our mail?” (43).  Through supplementing a form of a call to action, the authors are attempting to make their readers aware of the encroaching, potentially unwanted situation. Researchers Brown and Vaughn discovered in their study that 83% of examined Facebook accounts held details that revealed content about social networking users’ ethno-racial identities (Brown 223). If the researchers can discover such information, employers most likely can as well. In having accessibility to online profiles, employers can result in partaking in discrimination, for they can infer personal demographic information about employees and applicants. From examining photographs and social media posts, an employer has the potential to identify the account owner’s race, gender, age, sexuality, political views, and whom the user associates with via their comments and friends lists (Brown 223 and Davison 43). The information is meant to be a rude, informative academic awakening to unbeknownst readers, emphasizing the amount of valuable information users are displaying at their own risk, which may potentially impact a curious employer’s hiring decision.</p>
    <p>On the contrary, researchers reveal that employers argue they need to know what employees are posting, considering they’re representing their businesses and projecting a frontal professional image, constructing the visual, personal face of the company (Jain 160). In Delaney’s article, he argues that social media users believe they hold rights to limiting who can see the information they post, and that social media users need to realize they are posting their information voluntarily. The social websites they utilize, such as Facebook and MySpace, are free services that collect income from other companies, such as advertisers. Upon closer examination, advertisers are also employers looking for new working hands (2). Considering users sign up for free online accounts, advertisers may feel they have entitlement to personal information, seeing as advertisers already collect information through other ways, including tracking what consumers purchase at the grocery store, and looking at what kind of ads people stick around to watch on television programs. While the information is relevant to advertising, they may utilize some information to analyze their own job applicants.</p>
    <p>As a result of different circumstances and different issues, one may question where a boundary line can be formed and recognized, determining whether an employee can be terminated on the basis of their online activity. The answer, although still somewhat unclear, lies within the term, “protected concerted activity”, explaining that “using social media for collective dialogue and shared concerns about important terms and conditions of employment are concerted, and therefore protected activities [under the National Labor Relations Act of 1935]” (O’Shea 5). In other words, activities that are associated with unions are considered protected under the law, whereas individual postings concerning one’s job does not constitute protected activity, and businesses are justified in dishing out punishments, including the termination of an employee. Protected concerted activity gives people the right to complain about working conditions and have entitlement to free speech. If other coworkers are involved in an online discussion post, depending on the topic in question, the activity is typically protected.</p>
    <p>While both social media users and employers are fighting for legislation to protect their purposes, a crucial factor seems to be missing from scholarly research. No matter what or where an individual submits a post on the Internet, someone is always going to be able to see it, whether legislation is put into place or not (Davison 44).  Perhaps if college students are educated on social media appropriateness, they can be aware of what not to post before they broadcast the content to the Internet.  In a study titled “What is Appropriate to Post on Social Media? Ratings from Students, Faculty Members, and the Public,” conducted by Anuja Jain and a group of doctors, researchers gathered test subjects and placed them into three different categories, distinguishing medical students, medical faculty, and the general American public. The three groups were shown twenty-nine different photos, featuring different focuses of content. Each photo focused on a separate theme, featuring items such as cigarettes, comments on patients and partial nudity. Each individual rated the pictures on a scale of one to five, indicating a one as highly inappropriate, and a five as completely appropriate.  The study revealed that for the overall photograph average; students scored a 3.3 on the appropriateness scale, where as medical faculty settled at 2.67 (167). Overall, medical staff were more reserved as to what they considered appropriate in comparison to medical students.  In light of the different groups holding different views of appropriateness, the researchers propose that students beginning medical training need to be informed of social media professionalism (Jain 167). Yet they suggest spreading awareness only when college students choose to walk through the doors of medical school. Are scholars too late to help students protect their futures once they reach graduate school? Scholars seem to miss that perhaps we are failing the younger generations through not emphasizing the importance of awareness earlier in their educational journeys.</p>
    <p>Perhaps society simply needs to educate young people at earlier ages, catching them and spreading awareness as they’re just beginning to create social media accounts. If young adults are knowledgeable of the kind of content they need to be careful of, and realize that future employers are watching them, they might be more cautious about what they post. In a study conducted by J. William Stroughton, he observed the type of personality traits that businesses identify through content posted on social media. The study explains that if companies identify job candidates posting images of themselves online with alcohol, in addition to exaggerating how much alcohol they consume on their social media accounts, the content may cause companies to see the candidates as eventual risks to their businesses if they choose to accept their application (802). Through observing online content, employers can make assumptions about you, based on the pictures you take and the messages you post for the world to see. If schools initiate educational workshops to inform beginning social media users, perhaps young people will realize the holes they may potentially, metaphorically dig for their future selves. But what kind of strategies should be utilized in order to avoid professional predicaments?  Medical communications specialist Cyndy Kryder has a suggestion. She proposes a list of helpful strategies, including “Make your digital interactions productive and useful to others. Mindless comments fired off in anger or with the purpose of attacking someone are simply a form of cyber bullying. They reflect poorly on your online reputation and, ultimately, may not lead to the result you were looking for “ (130). She  examines a new developing form of literacy, focusing on social media etiquette. In her article, she takes note of online users throwing decorum to the wind, saying whatever they like to people, and holding onto a feeling of illusionary invincibility. However, in response to careless posters, Kryder retorts “You can’t unring a bell.” (131). Consequently, putting forth a positive, personal social image is just as important (if not more) as maintaining a professional one. Through addressing what kinds of manners young social media users should adopt, Kryder attempts to encourage students to look beyond the Facebook timelines, the Twitter tweets, and the Instagram snapshots, and think about potential long-term affects concerning future employment.        </p>
    <p>In retrospect, social media users cannot hold employers responsible for what they themselves post on their social media accounts. In spite of any passed or pending legislation, restricting employer accessibility to social media, the task is up to the users to hold themselves accountable and become knowledgeable of what they’re posting. Otherwise, they are potentially placing dependability concerning their careers into legislator’s unreliable hands. . Through educating young people as they first begin to create their social media accounts, the young users are given the tools they need in order to make smarter, professionally considerate choices in correlation to what they post. By the time enlightened applicants walk through the doors of graduate school, and job interviews, they will strive with chins held high, for they have nothing to hide on their online profiles. </p>
